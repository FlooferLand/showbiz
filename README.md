A fan-made Minecraft mod focused around re-creating the wonderful experience that is watching [The Rock-afire Explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyEbr6HvWy0) perform

I made this since Minecraft lets you combine tons of different mods and situations, making this simulator able to be enjoyed in VR via mods like ViveCraft, or with multiplayer with friends.
