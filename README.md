> [!WARNING]  
> Showbiz is in VERY early development, expect things to break and be unfinished!

A fan-made Minecraft mod focused around re-creating the wonderful experience that is watching [The Rock-afire Explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyEbr6HvWy0) perform

I made this since Minecraft lets you combine tons of different mods and situations, making this simulator able to be enjoyed in VR via mods like ViveCraft, or with multiplayer with friends.

## Addons
Showbiz allows you to add in your own bots, among other things.

Currently, very undocumented due to the fact the mod is in alpha.

Make sure to install the [Showbiz VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FlooferLand.showbiz)
as it helps with addon creation quite a bit.
