### General
- Fixed a physics engine bug that caused animatronic limbs to randomly be offset _(ex: Rolfe's left arm)_
- Added easing functions to Bitsmap _(ex: `flow linear 1.0`` is now possible)_
- Added proper decimal number support to Bitsmap _(ex: `move "eyes" x:0.3` is now possible)_
- Adjusted Looney's default rotation so his face points betwen the corners of the barrel
- Made Looney's barrel dark on the inside
- Other things I can't remember
